    <h2>10. Aston Martin Valkyrie – &euro;3,2 million.</h2>
    <p>An exclusive hypercar from Aston Martin with a hybrid powertrain, extravagant looks and stunning dynamic performance. This is a real racing car off the Formula 1 track onto public roads. The Valkyrie has an unprecedented level of downforce and excellent aerodynamics.<br>
    Unique aerodynamic performance was achieved through a streamlined body made entirely of carbon fiber, with aerodynamic elements unusual for production cars from Multimatic. Under the body of the Aston Martin Valkyrie are aerodynamic tunnels that create a Venturi effect, which ensures optimal air distribution and maximum downforce when driving at high speeds.</p>

    <h2>9.Lamborghini Sian – &euro;3,6-3,7 million.</h2>
    <p>The Sián FKP 37 is the first super sports car powered by a V12 engine and hybrid technology based on supercapacitors. Its powerful V12 engine, coupled with electric boost, creates an unrivaled gem of engineering and technology. Sián—lightning in Bolognese—is a name that captures the car’s true character, foremost its speed, which exceeds 220 mph (350 km/h).<br>
    The Design DNA of Lamborghini is taken to its peak levels: inspired by the Countach, the Sián FKP 37 has sharp lines, aerodynamic elegance and an unmistakable silhouette.Its totally carbon fiber body leaves you breathless. The electrochromic roof and moving surfaces controlled by smart materials are sculpted by innovative lines. The Terzo Millennio-inspired headlights leave behind an indelible luminous signature that will shape future Lamborghini design.</p>

    <h2>8. Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300 – &euro;4 million.</h2>
    <p>The Chiron Super Sport 300+ bodywork has been extended and aerodynamically optimized for extremely high speed performance. The perfect balance between low drag and downforce improves performance and stability, even at speeds over 420 km/h. The iconic W16 8.0-liter engine now delivers an output of 1.176 kW/1.600 HP, exceeding the Chiron by 100 HP.<br>
    Air curtains located at the corners of the front bumper and air outlets on the front wheel housings release excess pressure, generating slight downforce and reducing resistance. The new rear design is also sure to turn heads. The so-called Longtail extends the body 25 centimeters, allowing the laminar flow to pass over a longer surface, and reducing the aerodynamic stall by more than 40 percent. The new exhaust tailpipe configuration and the diffuser in the rear end also generate negative lift, while further reducing the drag.

    <h2>7. Gordon Murray T.50s Niki Lauda – &euro;4,3 million.</h2>
    <p>The new Gordon Murray T.50s Niki Lauda is an extreme coupe with a carbon fiber monocoque. The car weighs only 852 kg. In design, it resembles the McLaren F1 - it has a forward-shifted interior, characteristic teardrop-shaped headlights and lifting doors.<br>
    Although the appearance is rather dictated by aerodynamics. The T.50s Niki Lauda received a body kit, a roof keel and a huge rear wing. The ground effect system helps the aerodynamic elements. A fan is installed at the back, sucking air from under the bottom, which creates a vacuum and sucks the car to the road. Combined, the aerodynamic package and ground effect provide an incredible 1500 kg of downforce.
    <br>
    The interior is dominated by bare carbon. The compact steering wheel is made in the spirit of racing cars, and the readings are displayed on a small display. Instead of buttons - a set of toggle switches. The driver sits in the center, as in the same McLaren F1, however, unlike the ancestor and the standard T.50, the car is not a three-seater. Instead of one of the passenger seats, a fire extinguishing system was installed.</p>

    <h2>6. Pagani Huayra Tricolore – &euro;6,5 million.</h2>
    <p>The special "aviation" Pagani Huayra Tricolore is powered by a 6.0-liter AMG V12 engine with two turbines, which develops 840 "horses" and 1,100 Nm. Note that on a regular roadster, this unit produces 764 hp. and 1,000 Nm of torque. The motor works in tandem with the Xtrac robot with one clutch that transfers traction to the rear axle. When loaded, the Tricolore version of Wyre's roadster weighs 1,270 kg, but the company does not advertise its speed characteristics. In total, the Italians will build only three such cars. Each of them is estimated at at least 5.5 million euros (495 million rubles at the current exchange rate).</p>

    <h2>5. Bugatti Divo – &euro;7 million.</h2>
    <p>Exceptionally crafted, striking in character, strictly limited and with completely different driving dynamics – the DIVO is BUGATTI’s first modern coachbuilt project: athletic, sharp, with distinctive handling properties, stunning lateral acceleration and a unique design language. The aerodynamics of the car have been intensively fine-tuned for additional downforce, while the suspension and chassis settings were modified for an even more compelling driving experience. Powered by BUGATTI’s iconic 8.0-liter W16 engine –with an output of 1,500 PS and 1,600 Nm– the Divo combines incomparable coachbuilding quality with an exhilarant driving experience.<br>
    The Divo is BUGATTI’s first coachbuilt hyper sports car of the 21st century. The limited and extremely high-performance hyper sports car is an absolute must-have for any BUGATTI enthusiast’s hyper sports car collection. With its futuristic and ferocious design and its completely different personality and driving performance, BUGATTI has created a true masterpiece of automotive craftsmanship that successfully revives BUGATTI’s long-standing coachbuilding tradition.</p>

    <h2>4. Bugatti Centodieci – &euro;7 million.</h2>
    <p>The Centodieci continues Bugatti’s successful 110-year course of exceptional design and performance, while reviving the memory of the brand’s recent history. With the Centodieci – Italian for 110 – Bugatti created a reinterpretation of the epochal EB110, which, when presented in 1991, was considered the fastest and most extraordinary supercar of its time. The EB110, built by Romano Artioli in Italy, was an important intermediate step for the refoundation of Bugatti in 1998 and for the return to the French roots in Molsheim.<br>
    Inspired by the historical model, the Centodieci pushes all boundaries of imagination with its breathtaking performance and pioneering design. Featuring a modern interpretation of the classic wedge shape and with the iconic W16 engine, the Centodieci transports the EB110 gracefully into a new millennium. The ten limited-edition vehicles are distinguished by their perfect elegance and sculptural beauty, making the Centodieci a true, tangible work of art.</p>

    <h2>3. Rolls-Royce Sweptail – &euro;12,8 million.</h2>
    <p>There are two places left in the cabin, instead of the back sofa, a bed for a bag was placed. The interior is finished with precious woods, the secondary handles and grips have been removed from the front panel, and a refrigerated compartment for a bottle of champagne and two glasses is built into the console.<br>
    The technique remains the same as the original model. Rolls-Royce Sweptail is equipped with a 6.75 liter V12 petrol engine (460 hp), a six-speed automatic transmission and has rear-wheel drive.<br>

    The exact price of the car was not announced, but according to some reports, the Rolls-Royce Sweptail coupe cost the customer £ 10 million</p>

    <h2>2. Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta – &euro;15 million.</h2>
    <p>The new Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta looks familiar and retains its signature wedge-shaped silhouette. There are also branded round headlights and four exhaust pipes in the form of rocket nozzles. In this case, the windshield and side windows of the convertible are cut off, and the roof is absent (a soft folding top is not provided). An additional air intake has appeared behind the seat backs. The rear wheels are covered with special aerodynamic linings, and a rather large rear wing is also provided. The body is made of extra lightweight carbon fiber, which kept the weight at the level of 1250 kg.</p>

    <h2>1.  Bugatti La Voiture Noire – &euro;19 млн.</h2>
    <p>A pioneering spirit, passion for perfection and the desire to continually redefine its limits have been the key characteristics of BUGATTI since it was founded more than 110 years ago . None of the brand’s masterpieces reflect these values more impressively than the Type 57 SC Atlantic. Created by Ettore Bugatti’s eldest son Jean, the only four Atlantics ever created stand for pure elegance and sophistication.<br>
    With its homage to the fourth, all-black Atlantic, missing since the Second World War, BUGATTI is bringing the speed, technology, luxury and aesthetics of an icon into a new era. But the customized creation of “La Voiture Noire” is far more than a modern interpretation of the ghost of the gran turismo. “La Voiture Noire” is a tribute to BUGATTI’s own history, a manifesto of the BUGATTI aesthetic and a piece of automotive haute couture.</p>
